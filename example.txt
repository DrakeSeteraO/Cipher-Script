Hi this is a file that you can run "./chipher.sh" on.
However if you want more info on how cipher.sh works you can find the info commented in cipher.sh

After running the command "./cipher.sh example.txt" or "./cipher -e example.txt" this file will be encrypted and you won't be able to read this.
At least Hopefully this file will be encrypted.

You can also write some stuff here if you want to:

Ql ab9ovmq qeb cfib ork qeb 9ljj7ka "./9fmebo.pe -a bu7jmib.quq"



You can also specify an amount to encrypt by using -n.
To encrypt this file by the number 21 you can run the command "./cipher -n21 example.txt" or "./cipher -en21 example.txt"
